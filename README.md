# Universal-cable-extender
This is a neat device similar to existing extendible charging cables. The difference being, this contraption is significantly larger, and allows for swapping the cable without the device disintegrating when opened.
I would love to have this on something like my laptop charging cable, and one day I will have the brain space to complete the project.
